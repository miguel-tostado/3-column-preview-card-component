## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More like what I had to re-learn! It's been a while since I've done any kind of web development, let alone any actual coding so I was pretty rusty. I made the decision to stick with plain HTML and CSS for this project as I would've spent way too long learning anything more for such a simple component.

Thankfully, with a simple component like this it didn't take very long to finish. Even with having to look up references for Flexbox.

### Continued development

I definitely need to become familiar with syntax again and how to develop a good structure for each component. And I really want to start including more technologies like Tailwind CSS and React.
